# restartnotice

This simple script will email you when a given server reboots. It's designed to run on cron with @reboot.

Note: if using a gmail account configured in ssmtp, you will need to enable access for less secure apps at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps 

It is recommended you make a second dummy account for sending notifications, rather than making your main gmail account less secure.
